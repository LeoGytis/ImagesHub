# Imged Project

A dynamic image gallery utilizing the Flickr API.
The project emphasizes responsive design principles to ensure optimal viewing across various devices and screen sizes.
The project aims to deliver a visually appealing and user-friendly image gallery experience while prioritizing performance optimization, code reliability, and responsiveness across devices.

# Features

- Utilized the Flickr API (or an alternative supporting paginated results, unique images with metadata, and access methods) for fetching image data.
- Implemented responsive design techniques to ensure the gallery adjusts seamlessly to different viewport sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience across devices.
- Enabled infinite scroll functionality to dynamically load additional images as the user scrolls, enhancing user engagement and exploration.
- Utilized TypeScript for static typing to enhance code maintainability, reduce errors, and improve development efficiency.
- Implementd lazy-loading techniques to optimize page loading times by loading images only when they are about to come into view, conserving bandwidth and improving performance.
- Incorporated a responsive image solution to save bandwidth by loading higher quality images only when necessary, based on the user's device capabilities and viewport size.
